		<p>Over the next few years there will be a growth in people who 
		want to be more “<em>green</em>”, more <strong>self-sufficient</strong>, and take part 
		in the “<em>grow local</em>” movement.  A handful of egg-laying hens in a relatively 
		small yard allows people to participate in these trends without having to move or change 
		their lifestyle.  <a href="index.html">ChickenInfo.com</a> promotes the green, self-sufficient, 
		and grow-local movements by educating people on how to raise chickens properly. As the content 
		of the site grows, so will the questions from visitors... <strong>lots</strong> of questions.   
		Everything from hatching eggs to how to raise chickens.  We will try to answer as many questions 
		as we could by adding information to the site, but we realize there are too many different variables 
		to create content for every situation. The growth in the trend toward raising backyard chickens 
		and the quantity and quality of information gathered on this site will hopefully exceed any of the 
		original expectations.</p>
		<p><strong>Enjoy your time here!</strong> If you have comments or questions, turn to the 
		<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> it's a great way where you will get <strong>LOTS</strong> 
		of great answers to any questions you may have.</p>
