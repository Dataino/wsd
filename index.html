	<div id="divcontentp"><p>In a world that is becoming increasingly more complex and the price of groceries are constantly 
		on the rise, people are taking charge of their own lives through <em>homesteading</em>. 
		Homesteading represents the utmost expression of self sufficiency and self determination, 
		and is practiced by every one in a wide range of surroundings. Homesteaders across United States are raising chickens 
		and livestock, keeping honeybee hives, planting vegetables and fruit trees, and finding ways of preserving
		and drying food to keep throughout the year.</p>
		<p>At ChickenKing.com, we believe that <strong>opting out of an industrial food system</strong> 
		by growing food and livestock for yourself and your family is amongst one of the most 
		empowering decisions a person can make.</p></div>

	<h3 id="h3p1">Pastured Chickens</h3>
	<div id="divcontentb">
	<div id="divcontentp2"><p>Chickens were first domesticated in Asia about 8000 years ago, and came to the U.S. by way of Europe in the 15th century. 
				The average American eats about 80 pounds of chicken per year, which makes it by far the main source of animal protein in the American diet.</p>
				<p>The high demand for chickens has created bottom-line driven factory farms where chickens live and die in terrible conditions. 
				They're kept alive pumped full of antibiotics and nasty chemicals, and genetically engineered to grow artificially quick, and the people 
				who work in such factories also suffer terrible injuries in the attempt to keep up with speeded-up assembly lines.</p>
				<p>Grass-fed, pastured, organic chickens, grown the old-fashioned way, are still available throughout the U.S. 
				from family farms who care about their animals and provide them with good, healthy diets and lifestyles. 
				Their meat is much healthier and tastier than industrial chicken</p></div>

	<div id="divcontentp3"><p>There are almost <strong>two million farms in the USA</strong>. About 80% of those are small farms, 
			and a large percentage are family owned. More and more of these farmers are now selling 
			their products directly to the public. They do this via <em>CSA programs</em> (Community Supported Agriculture), Farmers' Markets, 
			Food Coops, u-picks, farm stands, and other direct marketing channels.</p></div>
